AI2 LUDO HAND-IN By Mathias Thor
=================================

The code is not fully commented as the function names should be self-explanatory.
Each player has its own class.
For creating the ANN-player, one would have to use the main.cpp in the
ann_code directory and the neural_network class in the code directory.
For creating the GA-player, one would have to use the genetic_algorithm
class in the code directory.

====*====
What are the different classes in the code directory?:
  ludo_player*:         This is the Semi-Smart player
  ludo_player_random*:  This is the Random player
  super_ludo_player*:   This is the ANN used for both the GA- and ANN-player
  genetic_algorithm*:   This is the code used for the GA.
  neural_network*:      This is the code used for the ANN and for testing.
