# Genetic Algorithm for LUDO

Start by looking at the project report [here.](https://github.com/MathiasThor/Genetic_ANN_Ludo_player/blob/master/AI2_LUDO.pdf)

The code is not fully commented as the function names should be self-explanatory.
Each player has its own class.
For creating the ANN-player, one would have to use the main.cpp in the
ann_code directory and the neural_network class in the code directory.
For creating the GA-player, one would have to use the genetic_algorithm
class in the code directory.

What are the different classes in the code directory?:
  * ludo_player*:         This is the Semi-Smart player 
  * ludo_player_random*:  This is the Random player 
  * super_ludo_player*:   This is the ANN used for both the GA- and ANN-player 
  * genetic_algorithm*:   This is the code used for the GA. 
  * neural_network*:      This is the code used for the ANN and for testing. 

If you have questions or problems with the code feel free to contact me.
